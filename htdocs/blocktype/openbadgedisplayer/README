REQUIREMENTS
============

Mahara 1.8 or newer.


INSTALLATION
============

1. Copy this folder to htdocs/blocktype/

2. Log in as admin, go to Administration => Extensions,
   click install link for this plugin under blocktype column.


USAGE
=====

The plugin is currently hardcoded to use https://backpack.openbadges.org/
as backpack. This may change when backpack federation capabilities are implemented.


In order to display badges in a portfolio or profile page, two things are needed:

1. The User must create public badge collections in their Mozilla backpack.

2. The email address used with backpack must be one of the verified addresses in Mahara profile.

After that, badge collections should become selectable in the block configuration popup.
