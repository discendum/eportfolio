<h3>Publicly viewable team work spaces</h3>
<p>If you wish to allow all users to create work spaces that may be viewed by people who are not members of your site, set this option to 'Everyone'.</p>
<p>In a public work space, anyone who finds your site (including search engines) will be able to see the work space's &quot;About&quot; page, and all discussions in the forums. However, people will still have to become a member of the site before they can perform other actions such as posting to the forums or viewing user profiles.
<p>Viewing the list of work space members for work space members and non-members can be restricted by the work space administrator.</p>
