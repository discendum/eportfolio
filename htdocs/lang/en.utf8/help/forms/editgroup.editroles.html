<h3>Editing pages</h3>
<p>You can choose which roles will be allowed to create and edit pages owned by the team work space. If your work space contains only members and administrators, then "Team work space admins" and "Everyone except members" are identical.</p>

<p>These edit permissions will also be used by default for new work space files. Permissions can be changed on individual files in the work space files area.</p>
