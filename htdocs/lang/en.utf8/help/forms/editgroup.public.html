<h3>Publicly viewable team work space</h3>
<p>If you tick this checkbox, most sections of your team work space will be visible to anyone who visits your work space - including people who do not have an account on this site.</p>
<p>Everyone will be able to see all discussions in the forums. However, people will still have to become a member of the work space before they can post to them. The listing of work space members may be restricted by the work space administrator.</p>
<p>Regardless of this setting, your work space files area and all files inside it will remain visible only to work space members.</p>
