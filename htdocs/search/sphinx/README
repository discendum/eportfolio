This is a search plugin for Mahara. It uses the Sphinx full-text search engine
(http://sphinxsearch.com/) and should work as a drop-in replacement for the
internal search.

Any questions, comments or bug fixes can be sent to antti.koskinen@discendum.com

REQUIREMENTS
============

The plugin has been known to work with following software:

* Linux (Ubuntu 10.04)
* Sphinx 0.9.9 and later
* Mahara 1.5.3
* PHP 5.3
* Mysql 5.1/PostgreSQL 8.4


INSTALLATION
============

* Install Sphinx. It should be compiled with libstemmer support. Please refer
  to instructions here:
  http://sphinxsearch.com/docs/current.html

* Depending on your database, copy sphinx.conf.mysql -OR- sphinx.conf.pg
  file in this directory to /usr/local/etc/sphinx.conf
  (or whatever you defined as default Sphinx configuration location).
  This file should be modified to suit your needs.
  
  At the very least you need to change the DB connection settings and file
  paths. Other options of interest are stop-word lists, character sets and
  morphology. See the Sphinx manual for more details.

* Start the Sphinx searchd daemon.

* Copy this directory to /path/to/your/mahara/search
  
* Go to Plugin Administration page in your Mahara admin section. Click the
  install link next to Sphinx, under search plugins.

* You need to modify the plugin configuration if you installed the Sphinx
  binaries in non-standard location or run searchd on a remote host.

* Set Sphinx as your search plugin in site options


Searchd needs to be running persistently on your server. I have found
this to be quite stable, but a monitoring service like Monit is recommended.

Content is indexed every ten minutes. This is done automatically by
Mahara's internal cron. You can force immediate re-indexing from the plugin
config page. This should be used for testing only.

Searches are logged by default to /var/local/sphinx/query.log


OTHER FEATURES
=================

In addition to the features replacing the internal search, this plugin provides
following:

* Filter by institution
    If form is sent using GET method and parameter 'inst' is set to '1', search
    results will be limited to current user's own institution(s). You need to
    customize search forms if you wish to use this feature.

* Exclude institutions
    Users, groups and content of certain institutions may be excluded from
    search results. These can be managed in the plugin configuration page.
    
* Find content
    The plugin provides a static method content_search. As Mahara doesn't have
    content search at the moment, you need to provide your own search
    page which uses this method.

    Synopsis:

    // $type can be one of the following:
    // 'all', 'forum', 'group', 'groupview', 'portfolioview', 'user', 'username'
    $results = PluginSearchSphinx::content_search($query, $limit, $offset, $type);
    
    // Method returns a multi-dimensional array sorted by relevance. Each result
    // looks something like this:
    array(
        'id'      => 11,      // id of the resource found
        'oid'     => 123,     // secondary id, if needed (e.g. forum post id, view owner id)
        'kind'    => 'forum', // result type
        'title'   => "title text",
        'summary' => "summary text",
    )
