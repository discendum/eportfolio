<h3>Blogs</h3>
<p>A blog is a tool that allows you to record your thoughts and experiences.</p>
<p>By default, your blogs can only be seen by you. By adding a blog to a page that is shared with others, you can allow people to read it and post comments.</p>
<p>You can have as many different blogs as you want.</p>
